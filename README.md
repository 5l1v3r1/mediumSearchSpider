Basic Implenetation of Scrapy framework


Step 1: Install Python3 and pip3. I would recommend installing the Anaconda distribution as it contains most of the required
modules we would need. https://www.anaconda.com/

Step 2: Go through the documentation and make sure that you are familiar with setting up environments in Conda

Step 3: Install scrapy 
                pip install scrapy
Step 4: Clone this repository 

Step 5: CD into the cloned directory

Step 6: You can run the spider by the follwing command

                scrapy crawl stories -a searchString="###search term###" -o outputfilename
